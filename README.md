# MiaPlayer

MiaPlayer is an audio player controller by RFID tokens.

It's made of a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a RFID card reader, an amplifier,
a speaker, a power bank, some Python code and a 3D printed case.

All documents necessary to build the player are provided here.

## Requirements

Be comfortable installing Raspberry Pi OS, configuring WLAN,
using SSH, apt, the command line, a soldering iron and crimping tool.
Also 3D design and printing. You'll have to partly redesign the case
because I used a power bank which is no longer available.

## Usage

### RFID tags/cards

RFID tags or cards are being used to add titles to the playlist, trigger actions like slumber mode or change the configuration.

The following text is recognized by the player after beeing written on a tag or card:

Text: toggle_pause
Role: Play/pause.

Text: toggle_clr_plist
Role: Attach titles to the playlist or clear it first.

Text: toggle_party_mode
Role: Titles are kept in the playlist or are removed after playback.

Text: shutdown_in_45
Role: Slumber mode. Shutdown the player after 45 minutes (range 1-99). Turns off the LED strip.

Text: set_max_volume
Role: Sets/Reset the maximum volume. To set the volume limit, attach the card, set the desired volume and attach the card again. To remove the limit, attach the card twice without changing the volume.
